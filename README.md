# Dogs vs. Cats Image Classifier

## Overview

This repository contains code for building and evaluating an image classifier using Support Vector Machine (SVM) to classify images of cats and dogs from the Kaggle Dogs vs. Cats dataset.

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project is the [Dogs vs. Cats dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/c/dogs-vs-cats/data) from Kaggle. It consists of a large number of images of cats and dogs for classification.

## Requirements

- Python 3
- NumPy
- Pandas
- Matplotlib
- scikit-learn
- scikit-image

You can install the required dependencies using the following command:
pip install numpy pandas matplotlib scikit-learn scikit-image

## Usage
Clone this repository:
git clone https://github.com/sudheer0710/dogs-vs-cats-classifier.git
Download the Dogs vs. Cats dataset from Kaggle and extract it into the repository directory.
Open and run the svm_classifier.ipynb Jupyter Notebook or svm_classifier.py Python script to train and evaluate the SVM classifier on the dataset.
